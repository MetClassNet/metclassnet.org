**MetClassNet will propose new solutions to:**

* Identify the unknowns

* fill the gap in existing knowledge
#

**MetClassNet overall objectives:**

* Develop a novel computational framework to build multilayer networks

* Develop state of art computational solutions exploiting the multilayer topology to
improve the power of metabolism analysis

* Generate new biological insight by using combined power of the above approaches.

* Liberate the new software solutions and data toward the community.
